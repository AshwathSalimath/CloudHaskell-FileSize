# Use of Cloud Haskell to calculate Size of each file for a Given Repository and observing Number of Workers vs. Time Taken (in seconds)

## Introduction

This project focuses on computation of size of each file for a given repository utilising a set of nodes/workers as appropriate to minimise execution time.

Note: This Repository is continuation of work from [CloudHaskell-Repo](https://github.com/AshwathSalimath/CloudHaskell-Repo) under my account. I have already sent invitation for CloudHaskell-Repo.
